# Data
Data files used across multiple analyses are in “data_files”. NB additional input files are found in the folders for individual analyses below. 

# Scripts
Annotation and analysis of transcription factors in different wheat species: “species_comparison” (Figure 1)

Analysis of transcription factor family expression levels and tandem duplication: “expression_level_and_tandem_duplication” (Figure 2)

Analysis of transcription factor expression and co-expression: “homoeolog_expression_correlation” (Figure 3)

Analysis of SNP variation:
1)	Prediction of variant effects and plotting these per TF family: “variant_effect_prediction” (Figure 4b).
2)	Analysis of mutation load and pi: “load_pi” (Figure 4a)
